<br>
<div class="class" id="box">Albert Einstein, synonymous with the word GENIUS and the symbol of INTELLECT, was an extremely late learner and suffered from poor memory of words that resulted into dyslexia in his early childhood. His teachers considered him to be the most unsociable, lazy and daydreamer who was not even worthwhile to have a positive conversation. He failed the entrance of college and could not solve some of the simplest questions whilst in school.
<br>
    His views on education:
    <br>
    “Most teachers waste their time by asking questions which are intended to discover what a pupil does not know. Whereas the true art of questioning has for its purpose to discover what the pupil knows or is capable of knowing”.
    <br>
    “Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school”. “The important thing is not to stop questioning.”

His famous quote is so relevant, “Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.”
